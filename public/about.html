<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Bobo Boise, a dynamic and dedicated digital professional currently working on high-impact web projects at the University of Johannesburg. With a keen interest in technology, media, and innovation, I bring creativity, structure, and energy to every task I take on — from building user-friendly websites to managing collaborative campaigns across departments.</p>

<p>I specialize in WordPress website management, working with themes like Avada and Breakdance, and integrating tools such as WooCommerce, Hostaway, and Hotel Booking Systems. I’ve been deeply involved in coordinating event systems using WP Event Manager, as well as streamlining content for platforms like TEDxUniversityOfJohannesburg and the IATUL website.

I also work closely with internal teams and committees to enhance communication, maintain accurate analytics, support library systems, and ensure everything from booking forms to site visibility is optimized.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about using digital platforms to connect people, simplify processes, and tell compelling stories. Whether it’s helping a department showcase their work or making booking and scheduling seamless, I aim to make every interaction smoother, smarter, and more human-centered.</p>
